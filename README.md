# CCControllerAndClient

This is a simple client and server program that allows me to control minecraft turle robots from outside of the game through websockets. 
The client that runs on the turtle is written in lua and the server is written in python. Since the server is asynchronous, it is able to handle multiple connections at once.
This would allow you to create a program to control a swarm of these robots to do what you want. Things like farm, build, dig, mine, and much more!!
